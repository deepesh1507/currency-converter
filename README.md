Currency Converter Project

Developed a currency converter application using Java that allows users to convert amounts between various currencies. The application features an intuitive user interface, enabling easy selection of source and target currencies, as well as real-time conversion based on current exchange rates. Implemented key functionalities, including:

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed an interactive GUI using Java Swing, making it accessible for users of all levels.
- **Real-Time Data Retrieval:** Integrated APIs to fetch up-to-date exchange rates, ensuring accurate conversions.
- **Multi-Currency Support:** Allowed conversions between multiple global currencies, enhancing usability for diverse user needs.
- **Error Handling:** Implemented input validation to manage user errors gracefully, improving overall user experience.

This project enhanced my programming skills in Java and my understanding of working with APIs and GUI development.
